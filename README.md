# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
📊 Project Overview  This project focuses on analyzing customer data from a bank to identify patterns and predict churn. By understanding which customers are at risk, banks can take proactive measures to retain them.
# Task Objective
# The objective of this task is to build a churn prediction model for bank customers.
# We aim to detect customers who are likely to leave the bank using their profile
# and account-related features, and to interpret which features contribute most to churn.

#  Approach
# 1. Load the Churn Modelling Dataset using pandas.
# 2. Clean and preprocess the data by handling unnecessary columns and missing values if any.
# 3. Encode categorical variables such as geography and gender using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.
# 4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
# 5. Train a supervised classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
# 6. Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
# 7. Analyze feature importance to understand which features most strongly affect churn.

# Results and Insights
# The trained model is able to classify customers into churn and non-churn classes
# with reasonable accuracy. Feature importance analysis reveals which factors,
# such as customer age, account balance, number of products, or activity status,
# play a key role in churn behavior. These insights help the bank identify
# high-risk customers and design data-driven retention strategies.
